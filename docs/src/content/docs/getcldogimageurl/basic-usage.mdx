The getCldOgImageUrl function helps you easily generate Social Card image URLs (Open Graph Images) using Cloudinary.

This URL can be then used when defining metadata for your page within Astro.

## Basic Usage

getCldOgImageUrl makes it convenient to create Social Card URLs out-of-the-box.

The only needed prop is `src`:

<HeaderImage>
  <CldImage
    src={getCldOgImageUrl({
      src: "cld-sample-4",
      version: 1
    })}
    width="1200"
    height="627"
    sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 50vw"
    alt=""
  />
</HeaderImage>

> Note: The image above is rendered using the [CldImage component](/cldimage/basic-usage) for preview only.

<CodeBlock>
  ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
  import { getCldOgImageUrl } from 'astro-cloudinary/helpers';

  const url = getCldOgImageUrl({
    src: '<Public ID>'
  });
  ```
</CodeBlock>

The function simply returns a URL for the image public ID provided including default configurations
including a standard width and height.

getCldOgImageUrl is a deritive of getCldImageUrl meaning it generally has the same API, but provides
a few defaults for Open Graph images like sizes.

## Image Size

By default, the image canvas is based upon 1200x627. 627 is used to satisfy the 1.91:1 ratio requirement and minimum size
[requirement from linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a521928/make-your-website-shareable-on-linkedin).

You can use the `width` and the `height` to control the canvas size.

## Image Format

While Cloudinary's `f_auto` parameter ([format of auto](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_optimization#how_to_optimize_image_format)) is great for websites and mobile apps, having more control over the format helps to reduce initial encoding time, which is more critical for a social network to recognize the image and load it on first share.

The safe default format for most use cases is then jpg, as webp does not have broad support (likely nor does AVIF).

If you have the control in your application to produce multiple image sources, such has having a separate `og:image` and `twitter:image`, you can generate two (or more) URLs to produce as optimized a format as you can for the platform:
